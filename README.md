This is an example level of a game I have in mind.

This was developed fast and the code (and look) might be ugly but feel free to use it for anything you want.

The started point of this code was this example: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/canvas_notearsgame

The code of the files on the folder javascripts is not mine. I just did some modiffications to sprites.js to be able to load animated sprites.

You can test it online on the following url: http://luisdc.com/gameTest/gameplayTest.html
